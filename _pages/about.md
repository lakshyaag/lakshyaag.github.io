Hello! I'm Lakshya, a student of Economics, currently living in Delhi, India. I have a keen interest in working with publicly available data and building things that live on the Internet. I am currently looking for opportunites to apply my learning to practical scenarios and gain a wider, more holisitic understanding of various fields.
